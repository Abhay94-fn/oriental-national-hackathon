## 🎯 What is Mentor?

**Mentor** is an AI-powered study companion purpose-built for Indian competitive exam aspirants — JEE, NEET, UPSC, and beyond. Named after the fearless archer Arjuna (Parth), it combines the power of large language models with scientifically-backed learning techniques to make every study session count.

No more scattered notes. No more forgotten concepts. No more aimless grinding.

> *"Most students don't fail because they lack intelligence. They fail because they lack the right system."*

Mentor **is** that system.

## ✨ Features

### 📊 Dashboard
A bird's-eye view of your preparation journey — study streaks, daily progress, exam countdown, and analytics — all in one glanceable screen.

### 🤖 AI Tutor
A conversational doubt-solving engine powered by Claude AI. Ask anything — from thermodynamics to organic chemistry to polity — and get clear, exam-oriented explanations instantly.

### 🧠 Retention Engine
Built on the **SM-2 spaced repetition algorithm**, the Retention Engine surfaces concepts at the exact moment your brain is about to forget them — maximizing long-term retention with minimum effort.

### 🎬 Study Lab
Paste any YouTube lecture URL and get back a structured set of notes, key points, and summaries. Turn hours of video into scannable, reviewable knowledge in seconds.

### 📝 Practice Arena
Generates targeted practice sets based on your weak areas, followed by detailed performance analysis to close the loop on learning.

### 📅 Smart Planner
Automatically generates a 7-day personalized study schedule, with drag-and-drop session management so you stay in control.

## 🏅 Hackathon

This project was built for **Dev Clash**, part of **Anantya'26** — the annual technical fest of **NIT Raipur**, organized by **Aavartan**.

🥉 **We secured 3rd Place** out of all participating teams.

The challenge demanded a functional, impactful product built within strict time constraints. Mentor was conceived, designed, and shipped from scratch during the hackathon.
